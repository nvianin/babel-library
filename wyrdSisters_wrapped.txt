”I’m going home,” said the duchess.
A woman with dark curls and thick glasses was put in charge of translating.
“Lancaster!” she said.
“She’s in the bath,” said the duke.
“Yes, but I’m going to bed. Come tomorrow morning, if you want, mistress. I’m sure you are,” she added.
“Yes, my good. And if you can’t get in the water, I’ll knock at your door. Now, if you’re up to it, I’ll come down, too. Now, if you’re ready, I can go.”
The duke peered out the crack in the door.
“Yes, madam?”
“I think, er, I think about what’s happened since you left. Seems a bit different.”
“It is, madam. It does affect people, doesn’t it?”
“Yes, my lady.”
“But it’s a good thing, then, that—that things work as they do. Because otherwise this land…this kingdom—”
The duchess peered at him through the mists of her own dream.
“This kingdom…?” she said.
“This kingdom is a place, madam. If you–?”
“–if you go, of course,” said the duke.
“Exactly. Right.”
“Right.”
The duchess climbed down from her throne, and picked up a mug of tea from a rack on her throne.
“I shall need it,” she said. “Good night.”
She stared out the window again, and the duke reached down and picked up a rock from his breastplate.
“Good night, madam.”
“Good night, my lord. Good night.”
“And good luck with that bargaining, you fat, hairy…”
“You’re welcome to use it,” said the "He has shown himself to be an honorable man, in my opinion," he said.
The three of them stood on either side of the door.
“Is there a problem?” said Granny.
“No,” said Magrat. “There’s just been this one odd incident. I reckon we’ve got ourselves a fine night out, now, eh?”
“It’s not that,” said Granny. “It’s just that I feel a bit dirty after.”
“You’re not the first, are you?” said Magrat. “You haven’t even washed your hair, have you?”
“No.”
“Well, no one’s ever noticed, has there?”
“No.”
“Well, I don’t know. Look, if it doesn’t interfere, I can’t see clearly at night.”
Granny rummaged in the back of her bag.
“What do you want from me?” she said.
“I just wanted to wash my hair,” said Magrat.
“Good.”
Granny sat down beside her.
“Well, if it helps,” she said. “how about washing your bag?”
“I washed it yesterday, and it was all fine.”
“Then why is your hand so cold?”
“I think it’s because of me.”
“But I didn’t do anything!”

Maud writhed under the weight of the pot.
“I think we should do it quietly,” she said.
“That’s right,” said Tomjon. “You should slow things down, you know.”
“What’ve you going to slow it down for?”
“I’ll just leave you two to it,” said Maud. “I’ll be back in a bit.”
“Where’s Granny?”
“She’s with the old woman in the village, is what I heard. She’s washing her hair.”
“You!”
“You’re a-burning,” said Tomjon. Maud took this as an enthusiastic endorsement. It wasn’t lost on Tomjon that her being drunk was a factor in this, and he’d have to give her the benefit of the doubt when it came to his own physical well-being.
“I can deal with a bit of extra willpower,” she added. “Plus I got these lumps in my thighs.”
“And you got these,” said Granny.
“Well, they were my jam,” said Tomjon, who was beginning to sweat. “I couldn’t stand it any longer. I put them all away.”
Granny dropped her boiling pot of butter.
“You’re a dirty old man, going around beating people up for no reason at all,” she said.
“I’d do much worse under your nose,” said Tomjon, who was beginning to sweat again.
“You ain’t going to,” said Granny. “I mean, it’s not like I’m under no master. I just happen to be your granddaughter’s great-granddaughter, anyway. I shouldn’t need no stinkin’ nosehin.”

 The idea that the entire Arab world has a vested interest in stability in the Middle East is, to put it mildly, not one which is easily accepted.
The Middle East is a region of competing national claims, each of which has developed a highly developed legal and regulatory system over a long period of time.
Contrary to popular belief, there are no independent borders in the Middle East. Rather, there are competing claims to territory stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.
The region has been divided into three distinct administrative regions since the death of the last pharaoh in the 17th Dynasty.
The three main ethnic groups in the region – the Druze, the Bedouins and the Aramaic-speaking Palestinians – all claim some kind of ancestral homeland.
In practice, however, the three main territorial claims are rarely challenged head-on and are instead settled through a series of negotiation processes, often involving the use of poison.
The system has two main components. Firstly, the area being claimed is divided up between three administrative regions: the Desert of Jura (present-day An-Nahar), the Plain of Ein-Nir (present-day Deir Zor) and the River Jordan (present-day Jordan).
Secondly, these three administrative regions also contain a total of eight smaller independent cantons, each with its own governor, sheriff and even a few witches.
The main obstacle to the development of any one of these areas being settled entirely by an invading army is that the area would be in immediate danger of becoming a "settled" area.
For example, the governor of An-Nahar, a large, mostly desert region about the size of the Netherlands, would immediately become very concerned if he was told by a passing camel driver that the two of them would soon be moving on.
Governors in smaller areas tend to be more professional and, therefore, more likely to be loyal to their administrations.
Legislative bodies, on the other hand, are more like small tribes, with members often having strong tribal loyalties.
In many areas of the region where the governor is head of state, the head of the local political party.
Legislative bodies are also much smaller and more dispersed, so that it is very difficult for one administration to completely rule over an area.
This makes it all the more important that local rulers are loyal to their political parties, and are not easily "What about the rest of you?"
The guardsmen stared at one another, then at the woman in the rags.
“We’ll go,” she said. “We’ll go.”
“But you were with them all the time,” said one of the guards.
“We’re with the whole point,” said the other. “We’re not there anymore. We’re not real witches.”
“We never were,” said the Fool. “We’re just characters in a great many people’s imaginations.”
“What a terrible thing to say,” said the captain. “But saying you’re not real frees you to do anything.”
“We’re playing a dangerous game,” said the Fool. “As dangerous as anything you could possibly play.”
“We’ll play it our way,” said the captain.
“But we’ve got to go back to Arendelle,” said the Fool. “And we’ve got to be with someone.”
“Someone who could play us,” said the captain. “Someone who could feel our pain.”
“You’re a Fool, aren’t you?”
“Yes.”
“That’s a fool’t trick, is it?”
“It is, but it’s a nice trick.”
“Well, I’ve got guts,” said the Fool. “I can take a beating.”
“You’re no good. You’re nothing but a stage.”
“You know what? I’m done being a Fool. I’m playing my part.”
“You’re no good.”

“Yes.”
“Good.”
“You’ve been with a dozen women since we moved into this village. It will probably last forever,” says Nanny.
“I’m sorry?”
“I was just thinking,” says Nanny.
“It will probably last forever?”
“Well, yes.”
“You’ve been together for a long time, anyway. It could all go wrong.”
“It won’t. It’s bound to.”
“I’ll be there, won’t I?”
“We don’t need us, though, does he, Mr.’Callander?”
“Yes, Master Hwel.”
Hwel looks at the three witches.
“You two are my—?” he says.
“We’re witches, aren’t you, Mardon?” Nanny alerts the silence that she’s deaf.
“Are you two insane?” says Hwel.
“Yes, Master Hwel. What are we going to do?” says Nanny.
“Make the most of this terrible opportunity,” says Hwel. “We could be like Thetis and cast a charm on the goose that lays the golden egg and bring back the rightful king. That would be really good for the Church.”
He looks down at the floor. “You two are crazy,” he mutters.
“Yes, Master Hwel. But I’m sorry. I thought I was helping.”
“Just shut up a bit, will there?” says Nanny.
“Sorry.”

Biography
The Dark Arts
According to legend, King Verence the Good was buried with honour in Lancre, and his coffin was decorated with many of the trophies of war. In truth, however, it was covered with unwashed mattresses, ancient razor blades, a single-edged sword, and a toothpick.
One night, while the king was asleep, the duke had an unlucky dream in which a dog came and bit his finger. The reader is advised to imagine this as a nightmare rather than as a nightmare occurring to a real finger.
King Verence awoke in agony, and had to be carried to the castle by the duke's body. Though the king complained of a lump in his throat, the duke thought the worst of him, and set about removing all traces of him.
King Verence was laid to sleep in a simple casket, and the following morning his murderer was decapitated.
During the Middle Ages, when a body was to be exhumed, the head was usually placed in a sack and carried several miles in the cold, unfruitful air of the night.
Although not a god of death, the Grim Reaper is the patron god of the night. He is said to haunt graveyards, and his skull is said to carry the keys to the kingdom.
Although his real name is unknown, the Grim Reaper is also known as the Keeper of the Coffin, and is regarded as such by his assistants.
He is described as a long thin man, with black hair falling over his eyes. He is accompanied by two small dogs, and is said to haunt graveyards.
He is also said to haunt castles, and is said to hunt small children in their sleep.
He is said to haunt the dead, and to haunt the dead can find their arms and legs, as well as sometimes their heads.
He is said to haunt forests, and sometimes to find his victims in them.
He is said to haunt dungeons, and sometimes to find their walls and passages to be a source of delight and even of unease.

“‘What?’
The playwright cleared his throat.
“I don’t mean to be rude, but you know what I mean.”
“What?”
“You know what I mean.”
“What you mean, old man?”
The playwright looked at the stage, which was now empty.
“What I meant was—”
“What I meant was,” said the dwarf, and there was silence again.
The playwright leaned forward in his seat.
“I’ll leave it at that.”
“What I meant was,” he went on, with a certain amount of desperation in his voice, “that I didn’t think it was right that the hero was always the one who did the saving.”
“Right.”
“Well, that was me.”
“And that was me.”
“And so it is with you. You can’t be both good and bad.”
The playwright looked at the audience. They had all sat there with their faces to the stage. They had all seen him do it. He could see them. They were the audience.
“You’re all the audience,” he said.
“Right.”
“And I said, ‘If you’re not going to choose,’ I said. And everyone—’except for the Fool, who was standing really still—”
He hesitated.
“Right.”
“—stood up. The rest of us watched them tumble backward, their lives hanging in the balance.”
The playwright looked at the stage again. The silence was broken by the sound of the Fool’s muffled scream.
“Right.”
“And I said, ‘If you’re going to kill, you’ll kill good.’”
He stood up.
“Right.”
“And then I said, unless you want to be king, you can go home. It's been a while, isn’t it?”
“Yes,” said Granny Weatherwax. “It’s been a while since we’ve done anything.”
“Do you have any tea?”
“Certainly not,” said Granny.
“Well, you’ve been long gone.”
“I was up all night making the window,” said Granny. “It’s been a long road.”
“A long road,” said Nanny Ogg. “But it’s worth it.”
“Thank you. Just a minute.”
Nanny Ogg stood up, and her dress gave in a tingle as it was tugged behind her. A trickle of water darted down her nose.
“Are you all right?” she said. “You looked a bit pale.”
“I should think I should,” said Granny. “You ever seen A Wizard in the House of Wittelscar?”
“Oh,” said Nanny. “That’s our Nanny.”
“Oh. Well.”
“Well, I didn’t want you two getting in one another’s way, so I slipped out.”
“Yes. Very clever.”
“Well, I didn’t want you two getting in one another’s way, so I slipped out.”
“Yes. Very clever.” Granny Weatherwax sighed. She looked around the table and waved a dismissive hand.
“You know,” said Nanny. “There’s a lot of old mud in here. It doesn’t mix well. I used to be a miner, back in the day.”
“Yes, but you know—”
“It’s all part of the job,” said Nanny. “You don’t get paid if you don’t. You just keep on mining. There’s no expecting anything from me.”
“You’re a The city of Boston, by all accounts, is not a very good place to live. While the average household earns over $50,000 a year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 20 percent of the city's children live in poverty, and more than half of its older residents are either disabled or on Social Security.
This is hardly an indictment of the city, which boasts a relatively high standard of living. But it does raise the question: Why is Boston so lousy at attracting and keeping talented people?

The city has three main problems. The first two are well-known: low wages and bad schools. The third problem is less well-known but nonetheless a serious one: crime.
Get Future Tense in Your Inbox
Low wages.
Low-paying jobs.
School choice.
As a rule, poor people don't have a lot of money. A family of four making, say, $18 an hour would still be making about $19 an hour in the city as a whole. In the city of Boston, where the median household income is about $50,000, that means that about 60 percent of the residents earn less than the poverty line.
So what explains this bizarre phenomenon?
Well, one possibility is that the jobs that are available to people from low- and middle-income backgrounds tend to be low-paying. A lot of the jobs that people from different socioeconomic backgrounds want tend to be jobs that pay a lot of money. As a result, they tend to look for them.
Advertisement
And jobs that pay a lot of money tend to attract people. Boston is a big city, and the jobs available to people in their 20s, 30s, and so on tend to do just that.
Job creation in the United States is strongly linked to both the labor supply and the labor demand curves.
So, in other words, if you want to attract and keep good people, you need to attract people from a certain age bracket, and you need to do it fast.
The other problem with the city is that it is, in many ways, a poor imitation of the United States.

Now, if we could just get the cow to lay an egg…
Not that the pair of them was the kind of couple that usually had children. They were experts at staying together, and staying out of one another's way.
But there was the matter of the cow.
Somewhere along the line, the two of them had drifted apart. She didn’t like the way he used to act around her, as though they had known each other all their lives and were just now coming into their own. He was also afraid. They had a lot in common, and there wasn’t much that a cow could do about it.
Now he was asking her to stay.
She couldn’t leave. Not yet. Not now. She had to keep him here. Now.
She went home and laid the egg. It wasn’t very good. There was a bit of whining in the middle, and when she put it out it took some of the taste out. But the king brought it back every night at five o’clock, dressed in his nightshirt, and was always warm in his sleep.
She never once raised the egg in anger, even when he had knocked over her little cot and was trying to strangle her with his bedsheet. He had a healthy respect for kings, and she supposed that in a few generations he would be old enough to decide for himself whether he wanted to be one.
She dreamed. It probably wasn’t a good time, a bad time, an early time, or anything much. But she’d always dreamed that it was a woman who was having the child.
She never had to carry a thing, excepting the baby in her arms.
She’d been very proud of it.
She’d always wanted a king who could fly, who could hunt, who could brew and so on, and she’d spent her whole life working on becoming a better king.
She was going to be different.
She’d planned this whole thing.
She’d gotten down on her hands and knees before the throne and had been quietly praying.

WISCONSIN — A man who tried to rob a convenience store owner in Wisconsin in the early hours of the morning in June is facing attempted robbery and other charges.
The Gazette of Oulu, a local newspaper, reported that 54-year-old Olaf Skarlatos was arrested on Thursday on charges of attempted robbery and criminal damage after a shoplifting incident at the Waterstones in the city.
Skarlatos is due to appear in court on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place around 4 a.m. local time (0700 GMT Friday) on June 1.
The paper said that after the employee at the cash register tried to stop Skarlatos, he ran outside and told the cashier to get on the ground.
Skarlatos then allegedly tried to rob the cashier inside, but was overpowered by the cashier's assistant.
The assistant ran out of the store, and called police.
The cashier was treated at the scene for minor injuries and released, the paper added.
Skarlatos is a former member of the Roman Catholic church, the paper said.

Updated
Former Labor MP Luke Foley says he is moving to the United States to run for the US Senate.
Senator Foley is the first Indigenous person to be elected to the Federal Parliament in more than 300 years.
He says his decision to run is not political.
"I have had the support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across the country, and around the world," he said.
"I think it's important that the political class understand that we are not only there to be consulted, we are also going to vote."
Senator Foley says he will not be bound by party rules in the Senate.
"I don’t think you can do that, because the party rules say that you can’t do that, and I think that’s a very important distinction to make, because it means that I won’t be constrained in my ability to represent the interests of the major parties," he said.
"I’ll be able to say to the national election that I’m going to abolish the election of senators because that’s not in the interests of the country."
Senator Foley says the way forward for the country is not through the courts.
"The way forward is through the change in attitudes in people’s minds about the world, about each other, about the future of the country, and the way forward is through change in the way people live their lives," he said.
"If we want a better future for our children and grandchildren, we’ll all have to get together in a big enough room and change our attitudes."
Senator Foley says the way forward is not through the courts, but through change in attitudes in people’minds.
"I think people have an attitude problem, Ed. It’s called character. And I think people in this country are very insecure about their character," he said.
"They think they can change it by going The Philippines (CNN Philippines, English - Philippines) — A man was shot and wounded Thursday evening during a domestic dispute in which his wife was also injured, police and witnesses said.
The victim was walking with his wife in Pasig City when a man, who was wearing all black and carrying what appeared to be a bomb, barged into the room and opened fire, said Chief Inspector Grady Judd, a police spokesman.
No one was hurt.
Judd said there was no evidence that the man had been radicalized.
The chief of police in the southern city of Davao, where the shooting took place, said he had spoken to a former mayor who said the man had been involved in a dispute with his wife.
"She pushed him and he pushed her and she pushed him and he fell asleep," said Mayor Ronald dela Rosa.
The former mayor, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the mayor woke up around 11:30 p.m. and went to the bathroom.
"I went back in and found the mayor unconscious on the floor with a gun shot wound to the head," he said.
The mayor, who was in his early 50s, had been out with a woman who were both under the age of 30, the man said.
They did not know one another, he said.
The mayor was taken to a local hospital, where he was declared dead.
The mayor, who is married with two young children, was a member of the Barangay of Pasig City, where drinking is strictly forbidden.
The mayor was a devout Catholic, who read the Bible at home and went to Mass at the local cathedral. He was a regular at Sunday Mass.
He was also a regular drinker.
"I've never had more than two glasses of wine in my life," he once told reporters.
A few weeks ago, the mayor said, he drank about two or three glasses of red wine a day.
He also takes a bottle of bubbly every now and again.
The mayor said he had tried to give up the habit when his wife died.
"But then I also thought, 'Gosh, I should be able to beat this bad habit down anyone who tries to get in my way,' " he said.
He said he was determined to fight the drug trade in his ”The ice is coming off,” said Nanny, and her eyes glittered.
“It’s coming off, but we haven’t got the right tools,” said Granny. “We just dump a stone in and watch.”
“You’ve got the wrong tools,” said Nanny. “The one I have is the best. It’s got wheels and stuff, but the end product is the same.”
“You’ve got no idea.”
“I mean, look at this.”
“It’s a snow globe.”
“A snow globe?” said Granny.
Nanny Ogg rolled her eyes.
“I mean, it looks like one to me.”
“Well, it certainly looks like a snow globe to me on the ground.”
“You’ve got a bit to get me about that.”
“I don’t think it’s a good time.”
“It’s a good time, but it’s got its limits.”
“Well, I’m going, Gytha.”
He stepped out onto the playground and out onto the lawn that would one day be known as the lawn of wisdom. He tossed and turned in his chariot, thinking.
“What’s this?” he said.
“It’s a man coming to claim his bride!” said Magrat.
“What?”
“This…this purple stuff it pulling on the back…”
“What’s happening to him?”
“He…he fell in the rain…”
“And now you’re pulling him along…”
“It’s all right, my love,” Magrat went on. “I just hope he doesn’t get behind on his…”
“Sorry.”
Tomjon was pulling. The pull produced a kind of raspy squeaking.
“It’s all right, all right The U.S. government is moving ahead with plans to build the world's largest container terminal at Port Arthur in northern Australia, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.
The project, which has been in the works for more than a decade, will see the construction of 672 miles of roads and bridges, including a highway that will connect the proposed terminal in Port Arthur to the rest of the country.
Construction of the terminal is expected to create more than 400 new full-time jobs, according to the Australian, which also reported that the port is expected to become the world's largest exporter of container ships.

But the port is also facing a number of challenges, including concerns from local residents about traffic and noise, and concerns from the international shipping industry about the viability of the project.
The Wall Street Journal reported in September that the Australian government had put a proposal for the terminal on hold, citing concerns over the port's viability.
The Australian also reported that the terminal was in the final stages of being reviewed by the World Trade Organization, which could have potentially halted the project.
"The World Trade Organization is considering whether the Port Arthur terminal is economically viable, with a view to becoming a full-fledged port," it said in a September report.

The port, which is just 30 miles from the U.S. border, has faced opposition from animal rights groups and fishing communities, who say the terminal will damage their livelihoods.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said the country remains open to the idea of relocating the Port Arthur naval base, but has said that relocation would have to be through a process of direct negotiation between the United States and Australia.
Australia is the only country that currently maintains military bases in the waters off the nation's shores.
The port was previously home to a U.S. naval base until it was closed in the 1960s due to budget cuts. Since then, other U.S. military installations have moved into the region, including Yokosuka, Japan; Kings Bay, British Columbia; and Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska.
The United States maintains a naval base in the area as well, which it established in the 1970s The Indivisible team is proud to announce the launch of our new newsletter, The Indivisible Guide to DC.

“It’s a lot bigger than a man, I expect.”
The Fool shrugged.
“It’s a lot bigger than a harbor.”
“A harbor is a lot smaller.”
The Fool leaned forward.
“Well, a harbor’s got to be pretty big.”
The king was silent. The Fool suspected he was trying to decide how big the harbor was.
“It’s got to be big enough for a midsize ship,” he said. “Or is that it?”
“It’s a large ship,” said the king. “But you mentioned pirates.”
“Pirates?”
“Yeah.”
“What do they do?”
“Scream. They’ve got swords.”
“What swords?”
“Swords. Very pretty.”
“What do you mean?”
“You know. Pretty.”
The king sat rigid in his throne, looking up at the sky.
“What?”
“You know. The thing where they put it in—”
“What do they put it in in?”
“I’m not sure. Suspense.”
The king sat back, his eyes narrowed.
“You don’t have to put it in that way, do you?”
“Well…no.”
“You know what I mean.”
The king sat back.
“What kind of face will have to go with it?”
“Well, face and whip and such.”
“What kind of a—”
“You’ve got to be bloody sure.”
The king sat back, his lips moving but no words. His eyes glazed.
“You don’t even know what a whip is.”
“You don’t remember anything!” said the Fool. The most important thing is to have a good time, and there were a lot of them. This was not, however, reflected in the company of the people. The common people had no sense of community, and few had any desire to. The only one who had any sense of community was himself.
“We’ll have to do something about that trouser suit,” said Granny. “It’s turning people’s faces red!”
“I see,” said Nanny. “I shall have to sort out that other bit. Is there something else I can help with?”
“Nothing else,” said Magrat.
“Well…” Granny hesitated. Magrat was not a particularly good conversationalist, but she was good at something else—her subjects were to be seduced, she said, not persuaded. She was good at persuading people.
“I saw your groom,” said Nanny. “He looks like a roast.”
“I don’t mind, my feline friend,” said Granny. “He’s got a good mouth.”
“I am a groom, however you spell groom, and I would like you to present me with your crown,” said the man, in a low voice. “My lady, your grace is without a lord.”
Nanny Ogg looked on with interest. She had never before seen someone of her stature presented with a groom. The Fool had been only twenty-one, and Granny had been a mere governess in her early twenties. Now she was seeing, too old even for this, but she was taken aback.
The man with the princely air of older brothers had been king of Lancre from about the year 901, when the last great battle had been fought. He had been burned at the stake a thousand times, and was said to be dying of old arsenic poisoning. He had been buried in Lancre Cemetary, beside his king, because, he said, the earth seemed to hold more. The crown had been given to him by his cousin, the young queen who had married his brother. It was a beautiful hand-lettered present.
This man had been presented to him as a groom, too. The resemblance was uncanny. The first thing I noticed about the new emperor was his hair. It was a pale, almost grey, white that fell over his shoulders and was never combed. It was thick enough to be a kilt but thin enough that you could put your hand inside and still feel the rest of the garment. It was very Roman, even for a new ruler of Charlemagne's stature.
The only other thing I noticed was that his eyes were blue.
“I think,” I said, “that it would be a pity to see you go. It is a strange feeling to be without a hair of hair.”
“I was a bit short.”
“A bit?”
“Not much,” said the emperor, blushing. “I reckon I looked it.”
I felt my dress begin to droop. It was becoming increasingly clear to me just how little the town of Rham Nitz was used to being stalked. I had hoped that the attention might encourage people to use the space more constructively, but that seemed to only encourage the thing.
“I suppose you don’t mind if I drink?” said the duke, and took a couple of glasses from the shelf.
“No, thank you.”
I offered to clean the windows, which was declined. It occurred to me that in a town full of myths and legends the world of dress and forgetfulness might be a little more interesting than, say, the real world.
“Well, you know,” said the duke. “You don’t have to go and look for them, you just happen to be in town.”
“I know,” I said. “I tried the pub down the track a while back. It was closed all day. All the tables were piled on top of one another. The man in front of me was stacking the last of the bottles on top of him. It was pitch black.”
“You know what I’d do,” said the duke. “I'd put the bins under. That’s all there is to it. Besides, it wouldn’t be right to scare people with decorations and all that jazz. Like I said, I’m all about the business. You The man in question is a bit of an oddity in the wizarding world. He is brown and well-groomed, and wears no particular magical accessory. However, there is one magical accessory which he does wear, and which is in fact very powerful—a pair of iron-hard spurs which can be raised or lowered by means of a chain.
This man is not a wizard. He has no right to be a wizard. He is only a human being, after all.
He is not a human being, he is a bush.
“I’m not human, I am a bush!”
“Shut up, bush!”
“Shut up!”
The two of them flap up into a squirrel mask, and go berserk. The man whirls and whines, and the chains snap at his sides.
“Shut up, bush!” he screams, and kicks the door in half.
The rent in the plaster looks down at him through the slats.
“Shut up, bush!” he screams, and kicks the door in again.
“Shut up, bush!” he screams, and kicks the plaster down again, this time into the slit in the door.
“Shut up, bush!” he screams, and kicks the door in three more times, this time into the dustbin which slides out with a clink when he tries to pick it up.
“You’re a bloody real sap,” comments Nanny Ogg, as a third kick sends him sprawling.
“Shut up!”
“Shut up!”
The man tries to kick up more dust, but the impact of his first one is damp on the back of his skull.
“Shut up, bush!”
“Shut up, bush!”
The man tries to kick up more dust, but every kick just makes his screams more desperate.
“Shut up, bush!”
“Shut up, bush!”
The dustbins start to slide down the man, who is lying flat on his back, his hair sticking out from under him. He opens his eyes and manages a weak croak.
“I thought I was human,� Nigel Farage, the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, is being urged by some of his MPs to back a constitutional convention to rewrite the United Kingdom.
In an open letter published by the Daily Telegraph, around a dozen party members say the prime minister should call for a meeting of his backbenchers to discuss whether the United Kingdom should be reformed.
"This is a vital decision," the letter says. "If we do not act now, the United Kingdom could be transformed forever. The best interests of the people, and the country as a whole, call for it. The time has come."
It goes on:
The decision rests with you. If you do not support it, the people will. Your responsibility is to the country, and to its future. The people of this country elected you to lead, and you are to lead them.
The letter ends with a plea for supporters to sign a petition in support of the proposal.
The proposal has already attracted support from former defense secretary Liam Fox, who has said he would like to see the country "redone" to resemble "a small island off the coast of Scotland."
Fox has also called for the establishment of a parliamentary defense committee, saying that while the defense committee is an important body, it should not "do anything that might lead to the consolidation of a central government with exclusive competence in the fields of defense and foreign affairs."
Fox has also called for greater transparency in the selection of British defense ministers, and has said that the country should have fewer "military bases around the world."
Fox has also said that the United Kingdom should pull out of the European Union, and has said that the United Kingdom should leave the European Union.

“It’s only for a few months’dow,” said Nanny. “And then they run out of people.”
“There’s always next year,” said Granny. “I just hope I don’t end up like my great-great-grandmothers.”
“I’m going to,” said Nanny. “I really am.”
“There’s a lot to do,” said Granny.
“Oh, there is.”
“You know how they say that where there is smoke there must be fire,” said Granny. “I am going to do just about anything to get rid of that whole thing.”
“I don’t think it would be a good idea,” said Nanny. “The old king was a bit of a tin man.”
“I hope he was well advised, or he was in those days,” said Granny.
“Nanny,” said Magrat, “we’d all be right off.”
“I doubt it,” said Nanny. “They all think so,” she added. “We’ll find out. I mean, they all think so.”
“I hope they do,” said Granny Weatherwax, and turned back to the story.

The announcement came as part of a wider review of the company's operations by the company's new owners, the Fund Management Group (MMG).
MMG said it had bought the mines from the miners' union in December and would take over the operations in March.
But it also said it would review the way it ran the mines in the light of new management.
The Fund Management Group said it would invest up to £100m ($154m) over five years in mining and other economic development in the UK.
Analysis - Jonathan Head, business correspondent
The Fund Management Group is a large international investment firm. It is a big business in the mining sector.
It has already spent more than £500m on development in the UK and has large stakes in several other sectors.
It has already spent tens of millions more on infrastructure projects. It already has vast funds at its disposal.
It is also an economic development body.
It has already said that it would review the way it runs the mines in the light of a new management team.

AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to the long-awaited release of the final report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report has been in the works for over a decade. It was released last Thursday by the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The report is the product of more than a decade of work by more than a thousand scientists from 70 countries, and it is the product of the final report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
It is the fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The first two Reports examined the scientific evidence, the latest Report examines the political will. It is the fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC, which means that in every way it is the fourth.
It is also the first Assessment Report to be released in the face of ferocious international opposition. In fact, the only other four Assessment Reports that have ever been released in this manner were the last two, in 1998 and 2007.
The main thrust of the latest Assessment is the re-emergence of a long-dead body known as the aerosol of the once-famous British National Tobacco Company (BNTC). The aerosols of the two other major British tobacco companies, Lorillard and Altria, have all gone, too. The main contribution of the aerosols of the last two tobacco companies was to the impression that the British public were much more health-conscious than they actually were.
The main contribution of the aerosols of the two other major British tobacco companies, Lorillard and Altria, have all gone, too.
The main contribution of the aerosols of the five principal greenhouse gases, methane, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and water, has all been absorbed. The main contribution of the sun has been greatly diminished.
But there is still one major contribution, and that is the contribution of the human race to the greenhouse effect. And that is the main thrust of the latest Assessment, which is the re-emergence of the sun.
So the main contribution of the sun is greatly reduced.
The main contribution of the earth to the greenhouse effect is greatly reduced.
But there is still one major contribution, and that is the contribution The Great Barrier Reef is in danger of collapsing, scientists have warned, as a warming ocean forces seawater deeper into the crust and pushes the coral further outwards.
An unprecedented 1.5m square kilometres of coral, equivalent to about 3 per cent of the reef, are at risk of dying off each year, according to the latest assessment of the iconic world heritage site by the World Heritage committee.
The scientists who commissioned the report said the world had entered a "new and alarming" period in which the reef was being lost at a rate of one coral death for every four tourists.
The loss of just one per cent of the reef was equivalent to the loss of 60,000 to 100,000 cattle over a generation.
The scientists also warned that climate change was pushing seawater further and further from the reef, increasing the risk that it would simply pool in the deeper layers of the reef.
The report said that unless urgent action was taken, by the middle of the century the number of square kilometres of coral would have shrunk by one-tenth.
The scientists who wrote it said the Great Barrier Reef was in "unprecedented danger" because of the effects of warming ocean temperatures. The scientists who wrote it said that climate change was pushing seawater further and further from the reef, increasing the risk that it would simply pool in the deeper layers of the reef.
Dr Michael Schumacher, one of the report's co-authors, said: "In just the past few decades, ocean temperatures have risen by about 2C (3.6F) and sea levels have risen about three metres (10 in).
"This has caused the ocean to warm up, pushing seawater deeper and deeper into the crust, further increasing the pressure on the coral, and increasing the chances of its survival being reduced by a few millimetres.
"With sea levels rising at an average of around one metre per year, the cumulative effect is that by the end of this century, at least half the Great Barrier Reef could be lost."
The scientists warn that the rate of rise in sea levels was already four times faster than it should have been by the mid-20th century, and that the extra rise was already eroding coral at an unprecedented rate.
They warn that if the world does not act now to slow global warming, the rate of sea level rise will accelerate.

For me, it came from a place of pure curiosity.
I hadn’t heard of 'em. I mean, I’ve heard of gold, of course, and jewels that could…
The man opened his mouth to speak when all the light in the dungeon flickered and vanished, leaving only the knight standing in the middle of the pit.
“What have you got there,” he said.
The dwarf raised an eyebrow. “Well, I reckon,” he said. “Five javelins of gold. And a green crystal, which I reckon should be…?”
“I reckon you have one of the four true kings of Orzammar,” said the dwarf. “And I reckon you have one of the four true kings of Orzammar,” he added quickly. “And I reckon you have one of the four true kings of Orzammar,” he added, shaking his head. “I reckon you have them all.”
“I have none,” said the dwarf.
“Then why is there a noise like that?”
“Because I have them,” said the dwarf. “Because I reckon they are true.”
The man gave him a conspiratorial smirk. “You are a member of the Council of Three Hammers,” he said. “Which has absolute power because only three people are allowed to be on the council at any one time. Which means you are the youngest person to sit on the council since the Old Gods were abolished. Which means you are the youngest person to hold that job. Which means you are the youngest person to be sworn to protect—” the room went dark—"the secrets of the universe."
“I was never sworn to protect them!”
“But they do seem to be very important to you.”
“They are,” said the man. “And they are very important to me. Which is why I say, gentlemen, you with me? You with me, go and swear—”
 He was a bit of a prat, you know. Just a regular guy with a bit of a thing for horses. But he couldn’t help it. He was always good at making people want to do what he wanted them to do, whether it was by giving them an easy task to complete or by giving them a way to get to and from his place in life as quickly and easily as possible. That was good enough for him.
“So,” she said, “you two have been seeing other people.”
“Meetinging.”
“I didn’t know you had one.”
“Other people?”
“That was just for show.”
“I can’t tell you how many times I have had the good fortune to meet a man at a loss for words, only to have him later point you to some ancient and venerable custom or edict.”
“I know,” said Granny. “It’s just something you don’t do. You treat him as a person.”
“Yes, but you know what people really like? Magic.”
Granny sat down on the edge of her perch.
“Yes, but what people really like is people,” she said. “Like, really good people.”
“Like me, like me, like me, like me,” said Nanny.
“Like me, like me, like me,” said Granny.
“Like me, like me, like me,” said Nanny. She sniffed. “You can’t have magic like that. You can have science.”
“But you’ve always been like that,” said Granny. “You’ve always been good at finding patterns. That’s what you are,” she pointed at her boots. “You’re a witch after all. You know how people are.”
“That’s what they are,” said Magrat, “my kind of people.”

Background Edit
The original kingdom of Janissary existed from the dawn of time. The Earls of Ankh and Verence were the first people to discover its existence, and for some time had considered it to be the real kingdom of Janissary. However, in the course of time the story went, the Fool and a band of other misfit adventurers raided the city and discovered what they thought was the real kingdom. However, the fact was that what the adventurers found there was actually a ruined tower with all the supports and supporting walls of a medieval castle, and a bedraggled Fool with a broken arm in what had once been the great hall of the kingdom.
The Fool was greatly distressed by this discovery, and tried to console the Fool of Ankh but was unable to talk.
It was at this juncture that the Fool made a terrible error.
The Fool had assumed that the Fool of Ankh was a wizard, and had therefore treated him with the respect due to it. However, the Fool had also assumed that the Fool of Ankh was a wizard, and had therefore treated him with the respect due to it.
The Fool made a terrible error even in this. The Fool of Ankh was a true Fool, and the Fool of Ankh was a true Fool.

“Well, if you’re looking,” he says. “She’s not coming over by the river yet.”
“She won’t be home until after she’s had a bit of a bath,” his wife adds. “She could be a while.”
“A bit of a while?”
“A long time.”
The bishop’s wife sighs. “We’re going out tomorrow night,” she adds. “It’s only been two years since we last went out. It’s going to be hot out there. It’s going to be hot in the winter. We’ve got to be quick.”
“You two haven’t got any kids, do you?” his wife demands.
“We’ve got a lot of other things to do,” says the bishop. “I’ve got a husband and a family to look after. I’m busy.”
“You’ve been working very hard at it,” his wife says. “It’s not as though I’m supposed to be working at all.”
“And you’re going to be a decent husband and a decent bishop and all that,” says the bishop, who’s headache is getting the better of him. “You’ve got to be good at all of them things before you can be a good bishop. You’re not good at any of them things now.”
His wife sighs.
“Well, I’ve tried hard enough already,” she says. “I just can’t get the rest of the way there.”
“Well, you’ve been working really hard,” says the bishop. “I just can’t help it.”
He and his wife get out of the car.
“You’re a real pain in the arse The following article appeared in the November 2013 issue of The Scientific American.
The science of weightlessness is not new. The term weightlessness first appeared in a 1759 treatise on the Opticks of Laon by the French physician and astronomer René Descartes (1532-1602). The term is short for 'unlightning in the mountains,' and describes the sense of being completely outside one's body, so that one is completely immobile.
Physicists have known about weightlessness for centuries. The phenomenon was first described by an Italian astronomer, Giovanni Cassini, in the year 1452. By the middle of the 16th century, astronomers had documented the phenomenon in spectacular fashion, as they streaked across the Milky Way in the company of their astronomical camera.
By the end of the eighteenth century, however, astronomers had witnessed a complete eclipse of the sun, a comet nearly touchited, the Big Bang, the Big Dipper, the Big Ear, the Big Shine and several other meteor showers, as well as the twinkling of an eye from the Sun and the appearance of the Great Red Spot. In the last century, astronomers had recorded the twinkling of an eye from the wax stable Mercury, the appearance of the wax stable Venus, the appearance of the wax stable Mars, the appearance of the wax stable Jupiter, the appearance of the wax stable Uranus, the twinkling of an eye from the wax stable Neptune, the twinkling of an eye from the wax stable Pluto, the twinkling of an eye from the wax stable The appearance of the wax stable Mercury was enough to cause any astronomer to stop his observations there.
The last time an astronomer saw an eclipse was in 1828, and he didn’t stop until he had witnessed one in his entire career.
“I can tell you this,” he said, “as a matter of fact,” and the stars in the telescope twinkled.
“I wouldn’t be able to,” said a third observer.
“Well, it would seem so,” the astronomer went on.
“And what do you make of them?”
“I make no such remark,” said the astronomer. “I merely observe. It is only in the course of time that we shall be able to study the origin and progress of the human species and the causes which The Islamic Republic of Iran has announced it will build a new airport in Iran, the first of its kind in the world.
The country will construct the first runway at Hajar-e Khuzdar in central Iran, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Monday.
Construction of the second runway will begin "in the near future", it said.
The airport will have six runways and will be capable of handling around 90 aircraft, it was reported.
Image: The new airport will be capable of handling up to 90 take-off and landing flights
The construction of the airport will be supported by foreign currency, the semi-official Fars said.
Construction of the first runway at Kish, in the Gobi desert, in 2008, took six years.
The International Civil Aviation Organization estimates that about 60% of the world's airports are old or in poor condition.
There have already been several plans to build new international airports, such as in the US state of Washington, and plans to extend existing airports, such as at Heathrow and Sydney's Stansted.
However, most have been opposed by local communities, who feared that the new airports would harm the natural beauty of their areas.
However, plans to build a new international airport in the Iranian city of Yazd in 2013 attracted widespread support, with nearly two-thirds of residents in a survey of more than 1,000 people saying they would be willing to pay more for a quality of life they could be proud of.
Under President Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian government has committed to building more than 100 miles (185km) of new road and at least 1,000 miles (1,200km) of railway, including new roads linking the major cities.
Last year, it also announced plans to build the world's biggest high-speed rail network, linking Tehran to the capital and other major cities in about 30 hours.
The country also plans to double the number of nuclear power stations and build six more heavy water reactors by 2025.
The country is currently home to more nuclear weapons than any other country, with at least 152 weapons in operation at the end of 2011, according to the United States.

There was another shock, and a moment later, silence.
From the roof came a howl of pain and the crackling of silver. The second-story windows shattered in twain, sending jingling ripples across the plaster.
The roof caved in behind it, sending a dozen jagged potholes pouring into the void.
There was a whimper from the second floor, and then nothing.
The second-story windows had been kept shut by a series of self-imposed security measures, intended to keep out intruders. They did not look like they would stand up to the elements, either. A few of them seemed to be slowly opening.
The roof caved even further, sending a hundred and one masts tumbling through the landing.
The landing itself was made of salvaged pine, and was about as wide as a grapefruit. It whipped gently back and forth in the raging river as the Great Pyramid crumbled behind it, sending a million and one tons of stone tumbling down an elevation of some three thousand feet.
The landing was even fitter for it, in fact, because from within there came a low, piercing rumble like a submarine bell that didn’t quite reach the listener, and then a dull thud like a cake plate being dropped onto a marble floor.
There was a distant thud, a few seconds later, that said: it was an plus point.
There was another distant thud, and then silence.
The second floor windows shattered once more.

The Chief Justice, Gavan Ryan, made the comments in a letter to two other senior judges, Professor Alan John and Professor John Newhouse.
It comes as the government prepares to publish the royal commission into institutional responses to sexual offences, which has been told to prepare a report on the conduct of the royal commission into institutional responses to sexual offences.
In his letter to the chief justice, Professor Newhouse said that while he had great concerns about the way some of the royal commission's allegations had been being dealt with, he had also great confidence in the work of the royal commission.
"I have great confidence in your ability to lead and to deliver a fair and impartial inquiry," he said.
The letter was sent just before midnight on Thursday, the same day that the chief justice met with the royal commission's legal team. It is understood that the two men agreed that the future of the royal commission should be put at the heart of the chief justice's thinking.
The letter to the chief justice says: "The independence of the investigation must be protected, and, in particular, the identity of those directly involved in the preparation of the written evidence will only be made known to the complainants and their lawyers."
The chief justice said that if the legal team at the royal commission were to become aware that the identity of those directly involved in the investigation was being kept secret, it was that the lawyers should make that known.
The letter continues: "You must ensure that the investigators are provided with all the information they need to carry out the job properly.
"You must ensure that the royal commission is given the protection of the Freedom of Information Act. And you must ensure that the legal advice is considered and acted upon in a free and independent manner."
The letter ends: "I trust that your confidence in me will be undiminished."
The prime minister, David Cameron, said that the letter was a "very significant sign of things to come".
The prime minister added: "It is right that people should know who is trying to muzzle them. That is the nature of a free society."
The royal commission is expected to publish a royal commission report in autumn 2014.<|endoftext|>This post may contain affiliate links; please read the disclosure for more information.

“Yes.”
“And three great fires?”
“Yes.”
“And you said to yourself—”
“I’m writing a play,” said Hwel. “Three great fires. That’s all there is to it.”
The ghost of the fire burned itself out.
“You’re an idiot,” said Hwel, quietly. “You’ve got it all wrong. It was three pans. All the fire in the world can’t put out a flame in one pan, only heat can. But it’s the three pans that really matter.”

The d The U.S. and the United Kingdom are reviewing whether they should be allowed to use their airfields as command posts for the new U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, the Pentagon said on Monday.
The review is part of an effort to find out whether the U.S.-led coalition's air campaign against IS is working and whether there are areas for improvement, a senior defense official said.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the review was not authorized by the government.
Prime Minister David Cameron said in an interview with the Sunday Times that he was seeking a mandate from voters in a Sept. 16 referendum to withdraw from the European Union. (Reuters)
[Read: Cameron to campaign for U.K. exit from EU]
The official said the government was also examining whether it should be allowed to arm and train Syrian rebels battling IS, although he declined to identify them.
The official said the review was part of a broader effort to find out whether the coalition was hitting the right spots, and whether there was a risk that the campaign was not working.
The official said that, given the Islamic State's territorial gains, the campaign was not working.
"We think we've got a handle on it, but we're not there yet," he said.
The official said the review would consider whether coalition air power had contributed to the defeat of IS, and whether it should be given greater powers to carry out more operations.
The official declined to give details of the review.
The U.S. military has conducted about 1,000 sorties against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State has exploited the chaos in both countries, which it controls with the support of a small band of foreign fighters.
The U.S. has said it is considering sending ground troops home by the end of the year.
The United States has also conducted airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria, but those have been limited and its self-declared "caliphate" has been largely isolated in a number of urban and mountainous areas.
A second official said the review would consider whether the coalition was targeting the right people.
The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the review, said that, given the Islamic State's territorial gains, the campaign was not working.
"We think we've got a handle on it There is a thing in the art of fiction called the metafictional rule.
It says that the main character is in fact entirely fictional.
It also says that the main character is, in fact, a complete fraud.
This is what happened to the man.
He was a complete fraud.
He had been dead for fifty years, and all the family had to say for themselves was that he had been shot on the Goomansk farm in the late fall of last year. His five-hundred-year-old ears, which he had been using as a walking stick, had been hacked off and thrown in the river.
Now, the corpse was lowered into a sack and the ears were dragged back to the family thesaurus.

It was a sight to behold. A group of dignitaries, including Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, descended from the sky and, in the style of an old silent silent silent movie, took their seats with relish on an imposing and completely ceremonial platform in the shade of a fir tree.
It was, the prime minister admitted later, a "good show".
And it was just the beginning.
Two years went by. The next moon landing was to take place in 2026. The date was to be chosen, the prime minister had been told, on a "spirit of confidence".
The next year came.
And the year after.
The years flew by. And suddenly it was the year 1887.
And the next year went out.
It was a bitterly cold night.
The next day it was called the New Year's Resolutions.
It was also, for the first time in human history, a full moon.
The first twelve months of the new year were spent in unremitting slumber, punctuated only by brief but desperate awakenings, when the world was to be awaked to a new dawn of the new year. It is one of the oldest of myths, told thousands of years ago in the forests of Central Asia, in which a huge hairy dog would wake up all the trees in its territory and go out into the forest itself, to find that the trees had not woken up giant hairy dogs either.
The ancient farmers of the region, who had no concept of time, woke up one another in the middle of the night. It is said that the farmers of the world woke up one another in the middle of the night.

“Yes, we ought,” said the King. “After all, it’s only three o’clock.”
“Right,” said the Fool. He took the harp in his right hand and began to play.
“All right, all right,” he said. “It’s only three o’clock.”
“Right,” said the King. “All right, we’ve got seven hours left.”
“Seven hours!” said the Fool desperately. “Seven hours!”

Oleg Vorobyov, 45, was arrested in May this year and charged under a law that makes it a criminal offence to spread "false, malicious or maliciously insulting reports or reports of rumors" about a religion, race, nationality, language, social status, political opinion, property, language or medical treatment or cure.
The law was passed after a series of attacks in which Muslim men were attacked with iron rods and sticks in the street.
On one occasion a man was burned at the stake with a match.
Vorobyov, a carpenter who had been living in the same flat block as the women, denied the allegations and said he had been surprised by the charges.
"I didn’t know they were so serious," he said.
The court heard how Vorobyov’s flat had been pelted with eggs and bricks and he had been threatened with a hammer.
It was also alleged that he had been followed around the streets by up to 10 men.
Vorobyov had been given a two-year suspended sentence and was required to pay a £100 victim surcharge.
However, he was given a two-year conditional discharge, meaning that he cannot be visited by the media or subjected to any other form of intrusion.
The court was told how the offence of spreading "false, malicious or maliciously insulting reports or reports of rumors" was initially brought to the attention of the Metropolitan police.

In fact, Gaiman himself plays the titular character, a young man living in a fantasy world who is both the author's muse and a direct threat to his own safety. The only difference is that in the novel, it is the other way around.
This is not, as some have suggested, because Gaiman is anti-magic. Rather, it is that the novel is about a world in which magic is all the rage, and the only way to stop it is for ordinary people to become magic-worshippers as well. This is why the hero, a man in his late thirties named Vergil, is so determined to become as famous as his hero, who is famous. It is also why he cannot think of any other way of doing it.
There is something of the nursery rhyme in this. A man who is as good a writer as he is “I’m sorry.”
“It’s fine.”
“You’ve been a musician your whole life. You know how instruments work.”
“I know a lot about the heavens and the things that are,” said the dwarf.
The king looked at the stage.
“Yes, but they don’t do anything for you. They just stand there. They’re not very good at all, I might add.”
“But the drums’—” the Fool began, and was cut off by the king’s glare—“they’re really good at my taste. They change the tempo, they change the cadence, they even change the words.”
The duchess sniffed.
“Please, my precious,” she said. “It’s a delicate matter. I know it sounds gross, but it’s the truth.”
She turned back to the king.
“You know what I mean,” she said. “The drums just go with the job.”
The king looked at the duchess, who was still glaring at him.
“You’re a------,” he said. “You’ve seen what happens when a------ witch kill a------ boy.”
The outburst had actually done some of the fighting for him. He’d spent years trying to get out of the witching family, until his stepmother finally relented and let him come out as a king. He’d spent years trying to get out of the witching family, when his stepmother had been executed for witchcraft, for reasons that he couldn’t quite put his finger on. He’d spent years trying to get out of the wizarding family, when his father had tried to poison him with the bone of a bo­ram, and his mother had tried to cast a hideous looking Stop Polishing On By By, Stop Counterfeit Finger Hex, Stop Daydream Charm On By By By By At Most Two Wholesome Manners Ahead Of A Crowd Of Three, Cast A Divers Spell On The Table, Removed Corner Stone, Cast A Long, Silly Spell On The Table, Removed Corner Stone, Cast A Long Him and the other two entered the dungeon together, his in a neat row, muzzled, and exchanged a knowing glance.
Severus paused in the middle of the floor, holding a cup of tea. He was thinking.
“I thought you said you weren’t good at duels?” he said.
“Don’t know about that. They say you can’t win them underaged jousters. They call it the scent of victory. You just have to go over there and whisper, ‘Mmm…please…’”
“They say it usually goes down well.”
“Got any idea how many times I’ve had to be frittered off my money in this dungeon?”
“It’s only got to be once, because—”
“I’ll give you one more try,” said the old ghost. “I’ll whisper it like, like I said, I’ll fritter it off.”
“You’ll—”
“You’ve got to be kidding me, will you?” said Severus, and every bit the ghost heaped on the finishing touches his body had to shout, “Not again!”
“I’ll just start and stop it with a whistle,” said Hwel. “Just a bit of noise.”
“I mean, you’ve got a mouth like a jar of vinegar,” said Severus.
“Yeah. Well, that’s better. You could plug that up with a cloth, if you like.”
“What’s that?”
“A whistle.”
Severus wrinkled his forehead. “A whistle,” he said. “I thought you said something about whistles…?”
“You’ve got to let the audience decide, I think. It’s a bit crude.”
“I’ve got to put it somewhere, I’m leaving.”
“Where?”
“In the Chamber. Please do.”
“ The Republican Party of Florida is bracing for what it calls a "political earthquake."
Republican Gov. Rick Scott said he is considering a constitutional amendment to declare a state of emergency in the wake of the arrest of a top official in a political scandal.
The Republican-controlled legislature has already approved an emergency spending bill that includes the language for the measure, which is expected to pass the state Senate this week.
But state party chairman Scott Atran said the party is now bracing for a constitutional challenge from within.
"We're prepared to take a constitutional challenge from within," he told CNN.
The GOP-controlled Legislature last month passed a bill that would allow lawmakers to declare a state of emergency for up to two months if there is a "substantial and imminent threat to the public health or safety."
Lawmakers also could declare a state of emergency if they consider it necessary to prevent the administration of justice by the president, the attorney general or the chief justice of the supreme court.
But the bill also does not say how the state legislature would respond to a political scandal, let alone whether the legislature would have the power to extend the state of emergency to cover a political scandal.
Atran said the bill was "completely out of date."
"The original intent of the act was to extend the state of emergency to include political scandals," he said.
Under Florida law, lawmakers can extend an emergency declaration only to a 90-day period, and only if there is "a preponderance of the emergency facing the state."
That means a scandal involving the governor or the attorney general could not be used as an example.
The bill also does not say whether the legislature would have the power to extend an emergency declaration to cover a political scandal.
Democratic Gov. Rick Scott has vetoed a similar constitutional amendment.
But an effort to add an example of a political scandal to the bill failed last month by a vote of 55 to 44.
In his veto message, Scott said the bill was not clear enough about the scope of an emergency and that it did not provide enough time for for-profit companies to compete.
He also said that the bill did not provide enough time for the state to adopt "responsible government structures."
Florida is not the only state to consider extending an emergency declaration to cover a political scandal.
In Pennsylvania, lawmakers in late May passed a bill that would have extended a state of emergency You may remember the story of how the ghost of a king in a wheelchair went door to door in Bristol in search of his long-lost wife. He didn’t get very far.
It is true that in some parts of the world, where the dead don’t have the vote, they also don’t have mobility aids. In Thailand, where I was living at the time, people with spinal injuries are effectively excluded from the workforce. They are deemed mentally defective.
In Britain, though, mobility is considered a basic human right. The new laws mean that anyone who wishes to sell or give valuable possessions must demonstrate that they are unable to walk into the shop without them sliding out of his hand. They also oblige landlords to let tenants stand on their hard floors, rather than letting them topple over.
And they oblige pensioners to stand up on a hob, rather than letting them stand on their rump.
So it is with mobility. It is one of the few areas of modern life in which the haemorrhages are more extensive than the benefits.
There are those, of course, who see in this an allusion to the old days, when people with spinal injuries were relegated to a wheelchair and had to crawl their way up ladders and across chimneys. But there is also a whiff of it.
“I don’t know about that,” said Hwel.
“I think you should. You could be as good at it,” said the duke.
Hwel sniffed. The duke had been given a lot of responsibility in the course of the previous day and was beginning to sweat. He stood up and backed out of the room, pathetically.
“You’re not going to stop, are you?” he said. “I don’t want to stop until I’ve got you walking properly.”
“I’m not,” said the duke.
“I said—I said, I’m not, I can’t do it, it’s too—”
“You’re a sphynx, then.”
“Yeah. Well, I’m going to be damned if I can do it myself.”

• “Yes,” said the duke.
The duke sat down in a chair in the middle of the room. He was about four feet ten, and his face was defined by the scars that ran down from the front of his head to the center of his nose. He wore a yellow silk shirt and silk stockings, and he had a silver dagger strapped to his hip.
The duke was silent for a long moment. Then he said, “I shall see you later, my lord. I shall have my supper, after all.”
The Fool was still sitting up in bed.
“So shall it be,” he said.
“And then, and …?”
“Then I shall be revenged on you,” said the duke.
The Fool looked as though he was about to pass out.
“What have we got ourselves into, eh?” he said.
“You will not stop until you have? The Fool felt that this was well within the rights of kings to inflict heavy penalties on those who deviate too far from the accepted path, but the duke’s view was that this should not be used to punish deviants. The duke saw no reason why a king should not be allowed to punish deviants his own size, and so he persuaded the Fool, who was now even more reluctant to speak.
The duke pressed the dagger to the Fool’s throat.
“You will obey,” he said.
“Yes, my lord.”
“And now,” said the duke, lifting the Fool gently off him.
“And now how shall we proceed?”
“We shall tell our tale. We shall be honest.”
“How shall we act?”
“We shall act as characters,” said the duke.
“What kind of characters?”
“Shakespeare, for one. Or O the—”
“Norway Woodcock,” said the duke.
“All right. You can act, but you must tell the truth. And you’ll get your money.”

 LONDON (Reuters) - An Uber driver in northern England was attacked with a knife on Wednesday by a man who tried to rob him at knifepoint, the driver said.
Uber driver Ben Dyson said the man approached him as he was leaving a club in the village of Blackwall, about 30 km (20 miles) north of London.
"He was obviously extremely angry and wanted money so I offered to cash his card," Dyson, 35, told Reuters.
"I didn’t know him, I was just passing through but he looked at me really carefully and said: 'Have you got any change? Because I’m going to rob you, I’m really, really, really angry right now, I need your change, I’m a bit late to my first gig at Blackwall Comedy Club but I think I will give it a go, it’s only £2.50 ($2.80) I think.

"I handed him the card and said: 'Thank you very much for your help today and I hope you are well. I was a bit worried about you, I think you might have been the one attacked. I was at the wrong club today. Where have you been?')"
The attacker ran off but ducked under a parked lorry and then ran up and down on the hood.
"I think he was expecting me to give him a hand," Dyson said.

Dyson said he handed the man a piece of paper with the words “Beware of a Werewolf, by HR Huxley,” and a hunting knife.
"I think he took it and ran off," he said.<|endoftext|>For years, researchers have debated whether the brain changes that occur in the first few months after birth are due to the placenta or to the developing baby. Now, for the first time, scientists have linked the two.

According to a report from the London-based Open Rights Group, the number of people who say they pay no income tax in the UK has trebled in the past five years.
The figures, published today (28 March) by the organization, which advocates on behalf of the average working person, show that from 1 January 2010 to the end of the month this year, more than 3.5 million people said they did not pay any income tax.
The number of people who said they had no immediate plans to change their mind has more than doubled, from 1.2 million in the same period in 2009.
The majority of people who said they would not change their minds – 58% – said that they did not have any immediate plans to change their mind.
The ONSG report also shows that, since the start of the financial year in September 2009, the number of people who said they paid no income tax in the UK has more than doubled, from 1.2 million to more than 3.5 million.
The ONSG says that the rise in the tax burden on the working poor is a result of the introduction of the personal allowance in April 2003, which replaced the old low income pension.
In contrast, the rise in the tax burden on the top 1% of the income distribution has been much more gradual.
In fact, the rise in the tax burden on the super-rich – those earning more than £85,000 a year – has been so small as to be statistically insignificant.
In fact, as the following chart from the ONSG report shows, the top 1% of tax payers in the UK have actually seen their taxes rise by less than one per cent a year since the personal allowance was introduced.
The ONSG has long been concerned about the growing influence of the super-rich in politics.
It points out that since the beginning of the century, the incomes of the top 1% of taxpayers in England and Wales have grown by more than a third while the incomes of the bottom 90 per cent have actually fallen by almost the same amount.
And it points out that since the start of the financial crisis, the incomes of the top 1 per cent of taxpayers in England and Wales have more than doubled while the incomes of the bottom 90 per cent have actually fallen by more than a third.

“And you’re gonna cut me,” said Nanny Ogg. “I think I will.”
“This is no time to be arguing,” said Granny. “You’ve been very good this whole time, and I’m not about to change my mind.”
“Sorry,” said Granny.
“I was just thinking,” said Nanny. “You know how important it is to your own kind, don’t you?”
“It’s not important to me,” said Granny. “It’s important to them all.”
“I don’t think I shall interfere,” said Nanny. “It’s not in the spirit.”
“But I still wouldn’t)d I be good enough,” said Granny.
“You won’t be good enough,” said Nanny. “You will be King of Lancre.”
“Yes. And you will be King of the World, too,” said Granny.
“Yes. And then you will both be dead.”
“Yes, but we can’t have that,” said Granny. “If we're dead, they can’t kill us, and if we’re dead, they can’t take our magic, and if we’re dead, they’ve got to remember who we are before they can do us any harm, and then, when they’re done, you can say you were together in the King, if you please. That’s all. Promise.”

A small world.
He was aware that now.
He was aware that the vast majority of people, including most wizards, considered the world to be much larger. He was aware that the vast majority of people considered the world to be over a thousand times as big as it actually was. He was aware that the vast majority of people considered the world to be ten billion times as dense as it actually was. He was aware that the vast majority of people considered the world to be ten petabytes as big as it actually was. He was aware that the vast majority of people considered the world to be ten petabytes as big as it actually was.
And he was aware that, in fact, it was one of those.
He was aware that, in fact, it was much, much smaller.
10 petabytes was, he was fairly certain, less than a petabyte. But it was enough. He needed it. He was hungry. He was tired. He was…
He stopped, and nuzzled the baby.
“It’s a good thing we found you, Gytha,” he said. “Because now you can tell us all about your past. I’m hungry. I’m a bit dirty,” and this I’m sure I mentioned in the right way. Now, why’s your father against witches?”
He was nearly in the face-first position by the time he had finished.
“He said I hurt him,” said Granny, in a voice so hoarse it almost made the trumpet player stop playing. “He said I hurt him, boy.”
“He said I hurt him,” said Nanny Ogg, in a voice so hoarse it almost made the trumpet player stop playing. “He said I hurt him, boy,” she shouted. “He said I hurt him, boy, boy boy boy.”
The three witches stood there, dumbfounded. For a moment it looked as if Granny’s tirade would break the spell. Then Nanny Ogg’s fist came down hard on the back of Granny’s head, and she realized that Granny had really been the one interrupting the playing. The story of the first major shift in the fortunes of humanity, also known as the Fall of Man, was first told in the novel The Shadow of the Vampire by F. R. Le Guin in 1971. In it, a ragtag band of young men are sent on a dangerous mission to a remote mountain village to rescue a princess, only to find that the only way to do so is by way of a bloody, icy waste region full of skeletons. The village is terrified and terrified again.
This time the men succeed. But this time they also find a great red dragon, which turns out to be bigger and much scarier than it appeared, and which a bunch of them promptly butcher.
At this point the eyes of the world rolled back their heads. This was not a novel for the faint of heart. It was a novel for the fastidious, the erudite, the wossnameed, and it would be remiss to describe its principal characters as dull, even by the standards of popular fantasy.

They are, in short, by far the best-written fantasy series ever because they. . . .

Granny Weatherwax had written the history of the kingdom. It is a long and complicated history, told in vivid detail by every living author, and it is a history that every king, queen and duke would find instructive but which every king, queen and duke would also want to forget.
She had tried to write it down. It was a lot to sort through, especially when one is trying to write a history of a small kingdom. It is, however, essential reading for the reasons given in the introduction; Granny did not want you to forget the story, and if you didn’t do The History first you were essentially handing the reader your soul.
She had tried to write it in a sort of bardic dialect, using the sounds of the past few decades to convey the high and mighty and the people’s humble aspirations but avoiding the clashing sounds of the present and the hyperbolic. It didn’t help.
But the point was that, when she put it down, Thoughts sprang to mind which, when put down by a group of people who The dog was not even half as big as a small child, but it was enough to push its way through the gate.
The door swung open.
A moment later the dog was behind it, sniffing.
The elder dog was a bit smaller than the younger, and looked as though it had spent a long time in the shade of a tree. It didn’t have a good memory either of the past or of the present, it merely kept remembering what it had once had.
The elder one looked at the dog, which was now nearly as big as itself.
“I am the old dog, says the new one,” it said. It was a croak of surprise that wasn’t joined by a livid taste in the newcomer’s mouth.
The dog jumped a bit, but made the sign of the cross anyway, for some reason. It was a pity, for the old dog wasn’t much interested in history. It was more interested in the future, and the future was very important to the dog.
It was certainly interested in the future that the future would be good for it.
It was a good hundred years since the last dog had seen daylight. Now it was just a few hairs on the body it had been when it came out of the water. It was a long time since it had felt the pull of the elements, either because it had been dead for so long that its insides had just run cold or because the brain had stopped growing altogether.
It was a long time since it had felt the pull of the seasons. Now it only got one a week.
It had been dead for eight hundred years.
It had been dead for eight hundred years because the dog doesn’t care about that kind of thing, and because eight hundred years was enough time for evolution to sort out any number-phrases that might have been apropos.
It was dead because the dog doesn’t care about anything at all, and because eight hundred years was enough time for evolution to sort out any amount-phrases that might have been apropos.
It was dead because the dog doesn’t care about anything at all, and because it has been dead eight hundred years.
It was dead because the dog hasn’t got any other choice.
It was dead because the dog is dead.

They sat in silence for a while, the wind howling through the trees. Finally Magrat broke it by asking, “So, did you ever go hunting?”
“Sometimes.”
“I think we should get home,” said Granny. “There’s something we ought to check.”
They walked through the branches of the neighbouring oak and came to the base of the tree. A few leaves tumbled back onto the clearing, and they sat still without moving.
The moon was high in the east, its creamy headlamp beams that pierced the misty crags of the foothills. The air was still and warm, moist with the forest’s life.
Granny sat with her back to them.
“We’re lost,” she said. “I don’t mean lost by the tree, I mean,”
“We lost our way,” said Magrat.
“Yes,” said Granny. “We went off our way,” which was probably the right reaction. She looked around her.
“What way did we go wrong?”
“East Kilbride,” said Magrat.
“Oh. Right.”
“Well, we went off the A404.”
“Oh. Hwel.”
“He’s a bit of a local, don’t you think?”
“Well, no. He’s been in the workshop all his life. He’s a bit of a modern-day blacksmith, I think.”
“Well, we could always go and ask around.”
“No. Not that.”
“Well, we’re lost, and you don’t know where you are, and you can see all the way around again, and there are all these things everywhere, and it feels to me like…�”
“Unsettling,” said Granny.
“What?”
“Unsettling—” The President of the United States said on Friday that he hoped that the security situation in Syria would be resolved "very soon".
Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Trump said the "very, very sad situation" in the Middle East was a matter for the Syrians to decide.
"I hope and I think it would be a very, very, very, decision will be made shortly," he said.
"I think the situation is a lot better than it was. I think the situation is a lot better than it was under Obama. I think under Obama it was a very, very, a very difficult situation.
"Under Obama it was a very difficult situation, very, very heavily. But I think under Obama, you know, it was a difficult situation, very, very heavily.
"I think the situation is a lot, much, much better now."
Mr Trump said he believed that the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, had been largely to blame for the country's current crisis, but that he was keen to see the situation resolved.
"I think he should go, OK? I think he should go. He is killing people. I think it would be a terrible thing for the world if he remained," he said.
